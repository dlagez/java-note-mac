## How are you?

Hey, how's it going?   if you feeling good, you can say:good

answer: Pretty good, not bad, not so good, not great, not so well,  Why? what's wang? to be polite. then you will have to explain!

 **What's up?     not much , nothing much, this  means you're free and able to chat.**

Even though these answers mean the same things as "I'm fine"

It will sound a bit strange. 

A lot of the time, when we ask questions that mean "how are you" in english, we not actually asking about the other persion's health, we only asking to be polite! 



## What do you do for fun? What do you do in your free time?

i like hanging out with my friends, and stuff like that



## Where are you from or What country are you come from?

I'm Chinese

they may ask you if you are from the place where they meet you, for example if you meet someone in New York, they might ask? Are you from New York

## What's your name?

In this lessons , you are going to learn some new ways to ask someone "What's your name?", including one that you can use when you have forgotten someone's name

most native speakers of English would never say this, In English, just like in other languages

of course the easiest way to avoid asking the question directly is to not ask at all. just introduce yourself, and most people will response by doing  the same

**Hi, I'm roc And you**

you've already met this person once before, but you have forgotten their name, The most polit thing to do in this situation is to apololgize and ask again. There's a simple way to do this that's also polite.

**I'm sorry What was your name again?**

it has three important differences.

- First, A small apology can go a long way.
- but instead of is, we use the past tense was, This really important, as it tells the other person that you remember meetin g them. You haven forgotten him or her. you have just forgotten the name, This little word makes all the differences!
- Finally, we add again to the end. This is another hint that tells the other person that you remember learning his or her name before, but you just can't recall it right now.

## What kind of food do you like.

food is a great topic for getting to know someone, You might also find out some interesting things about the food culture in the other person's country. of course you can alse ask someone straight out: What kind of food do you like.

i might seem a little too open, like there can be too many possible answers

it much better to choose a particular food, such as a famous one from your country, or one that has come up previously in the conversation and ask if the other person likes that food. for example: **do you like sushi?**

yeah, i do My favorite type is eel or Yeah I do , it's so delicious

**how to give a negative answer**? Again you have to consider the other person's feelings and not too critical of the food. even if you hate it more than anything. i might be theri favorite. so you could say something like. **not really, I'm not a fuge fun.** 

it's good for the conversation and polite, to give a reason why you don't like the food. some good reasons are: **I don't like the texture. I just don't like the taste.**

Do you know a good sushi place?

when you listen to native speakers try to repeat after them



给我这么说：can you give me that, Can you give that to me. can you pass that to me

The reason we feel give me or gimme is a little bit rude is because it's a demand, not a request.

对你的同事说是不礼貌的：it's impolite to say to your equal. And it's more impolite to say to your superior.
